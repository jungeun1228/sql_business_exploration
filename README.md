# Project Reflection
## Summary
Eniac project (Group 1: Eduardo, Helen, Jungeun) 
Week 1 - 2024/05/27 - 31
:Explored Magist sales database (earnings, sold amount, sellers, delivery, review score) to decide if the Eniac company can sign the contract with them for Brazilian market
## Languages and Libraries Used
1. Data exploration with SQL
2. Data visualization with Tableau
3. Presentation to Eniac CEO with Google Slides
## Key Learnings
There is no right answer - we can provide our opinion and the evidence based on the data!
Communication skills: clarifying the roles between team members increased the efficiency a lot!
Presentation skills: good that we mentioned the need for further data analysis, or further discussion with Magist (future actions)
                      one slide should have one punch -> better to separate slides if you want to convey multiple messages

## Challenges Overcame
Lots of missing information from original DB -> additional analysis, discussed vague points with team members, took conservative approach and asked further need for discussion to the future partner
Confusing information can be added to the back just to support the main part

## Additional Reflections




Tips for README file:
this means updating your README.md to include the specifics of the project: How, when and for whom it was created, what dataset was used, credit to any collaborators or group members, how the files are organized and instructions on how to execute them
